#Project Lenny

##Objective:
Create an awesome miniature robot arm

##History:
I saw this pop up in one of my feeds [link](http://mechatronicsfly.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=333&sid=feb0f60f202b8590621250f84ff71524) and immediatley needed to
recreate it. I'm making to some slight changes, such that it will be controlled 
by a gamepad rather than a wooden mockup with potentiometers.

##Parts List:
4 microservos  
1 Arduino  
1 breadboard  
Balsa wood  
Zipties  
1 Logitech PS3-style gamepad  
(To-be completed)

##Requirements
